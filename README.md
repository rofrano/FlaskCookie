# FlaskCookie

You want to get started with Flask? You are missing a suitable layout for your project?  
Then clone this repository and start right away!

# But how?

This project was realized with cookiecutter. A python tool, which allows you to create new projects from templates.  
Of course you need cookiecutter on your computer to do this. Install it with pip globally on the computer.

```bash
 $ pip install cookiecutter
```

As far as cookiecutter is installed, you can create a new project by using the github url of this project:

```bash
 $ cd <into-the-directory-where-the-new-project-should-be-created>
 $ cookiecutter https://github.com/schenkd/FlaskCookie
```

Follow the instructions that appear and voil√† there you go!
